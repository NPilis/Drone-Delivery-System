# Drone-Delivery-System
Application solving capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) using own implementation of Tabu Search algorithm. 
The goal is to find optimal set of routes for fleet of drones with limited capacity to traverse in order 
to deliver packages to a given set of clients.

## Presentation
In order to test the solutions and illustrate the problem I made a live visualization of drones delivering packages:
